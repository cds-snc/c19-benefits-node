  <strong>Next steps:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>You’ll be asked some questions to direct you to apply through either the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) or Service Canada.</li>
    <li>The application will ask you to declare that you meet the eligibility criteria, so read the details carefully.</li>
    <li>You’ll need to pay income tax on these payments in the future.</li>
  </ul>
