      <ul>
        <li>Your hours have been reduced by 10 to 60% because of COVID-19.</li>

      <strong>To do this:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>You would enter into an agreement with your employer and other coworkers who do the exact same work as you.</li>
        <li>All employees who do the same work need to agree to share the work equally, and your employer has to agree as well. </li>
