  <strong>Good to know:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The bank will still charge interest.</li>
    <li> When you’re able to pay again, you’ll have to pay the interest that was collected during the deferral, as well as your regular payments.</li>
    <li> You can also talk to your bank about special payment arrangements or re-amortizing your mortgage.</li>
  </ul>
